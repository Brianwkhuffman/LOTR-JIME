        <h5>Overview</h5>
        The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-earth™ is a cooperative game
        for one to five players. During a game, a group of heroes embarks
        on perilous adventures, working together to explore and survive the
        vast and epic fantasy world of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings™.
        Throughout their journeys, heroes battle powerful foes, discover lost
        treasures, uncover forgotten lore, and customize their skills according
        to their role within their Fellowship. As darkness is rising, unifying evil,
        shadow, and corruption, it is the time for the heroes to take a stand and
        begin their journey in Middle-earth.

        by the evils of Middle-earth. No matter the outcome of a particular
        adventure, the heroes and the campaign progress. Eventually, after
        completing a series of adventures, the campaign will reach a climatic
